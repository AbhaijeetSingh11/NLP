    "So far, all of the analysis we've done has been pretty generic - looking at counts, creating scatter plots, etc. These techniques could be applied to numeric data as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to text data, there are a few popular techniques that we'll be going through in the next few notebooks, starting with sentiment analysis. A few key points to remember with sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TextBlob Module:** Linguistic researchers have labeled the sentiment of words based on their domain expertise. Sentiment of words can vary based on where it is in a sentence. The TextBlob module allows us to take advantage of these labels.\n",
    "2. **Sentiment Labels:** Each word in a corpus is labeled in terms of polarity and subjectivity (there are more labels as well, but we're going to ignore them for now). A corpus' sentiment is the average of these.\n",
    "   * **Polarity**: How positive or negative a word is. -1 is very negative. +1 is very positive.\n",
    "   * **Subjectivity**: How subjective, or opinionated a word is. 0 is fact. +1 is very much an opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more info on how TextBlob coded up its [sentiment function](https://planspace.org/20150607-textblob_sentiment/).\n",

       "  'y men who are here were any of you like little gay boysyeah you you know the gay boys im talking about weve all seen the little gay boys like the kids at the park that are just like i dont want to play hes like over twerking by the slide his dads trying to throw the ball with him and its like just stop it its not going to catch okay we know little gay boys exist which means little lesbians also exist but you never see a little lesbian because lesbians live in the shadows i want to see a little lesbian you know just a little girl like aggressively eating a muffin she doesnt know why shes doing it shes like i got to practice i got to really get in there and i think women we really fucked up we befriended gay men i dont think that was the right choice i think we shouldve befriended lesbians lesbians would be like come on we found a way to run a successful society instead we befriended gay men and theyre like bitch youre uglyand were like hes my best friend i like him cause hes mean to me in a different way and theres not like not that many prominent lesbians you know even now sometimes youll hear about lesbians like youll find out theyre a lesbian after they died like men will be like oh i thought she was just miserable and alone and its like no she lived with that lady yeah i know i thought they were miserable and alone together cause i think its still hard for straight men to sometimes believe that women can be happy without a man and i think even straight women i think even we know that thats possible and now we have the luxury to decide if we want to get married or not that used to not be the case you used to always have to get married im sure there were some women that like during world war ii their husband went off to fight in the war and then he died and they were like oh no no im too heartbroken i can never marry again this bed is bigand also for the longest time i think straight men they always wanted lesbians to be like two hot young women who would maybe like invite them to join and lesbians were like no thats not who were gonna be there was always at least one lesbian in a couple who looked like she knew how to like build a deck and that made sense to me that couple made sense to me because i knew who was doing the work now there is the emergence of the young hot lesbian couple and it doesnt make any sense to me because i have no idea whos doing any work hot women dont have to work i cant figure it out it just seems like its going to be two women lying in bed waiting for some',\n",
       "  'thing to happen to them like when theres a burglar whos going down and also whos going down i know the answer for gay men its both of you for both those things youre both going down on each other and youre both going down to the burglar to see if he wants to come up like oh you brought zip ties good we were already playing hostage but my biggest the reason ive been so fascinated with lesbians i think it actually comes from a jealousy im jealous of the lesbian relationship because you get to be a wife but you also get a wife that seems super productive i want to be a wife but i dont i dont get a wife i get a husband and whats he going to do whats he gonna do in this almost equal society we fought so hard for what protect me from who hes the guy most likely to kill meand so the fact is you know the reason i moved to barcelona as a strong independent woman was for a boyand being in love and being happy is the worst thing thats ever happened to me uh i was before this i was always single and i was miserable and it made sense and i knew why now im happy and im in love and its terrifying because it could go away at any point but i actually think this is the key to a successful relationship never feel secureno matter how long youve been in a relationship always think your partner could leave cause then youre never too mean like i treat my guy like an indooroutdoor cat im like you can go but theres good food hereand ive been learning a lot of terrible things about myself in this relationship like um i i learned that apparently im a nurturer like uh despite any of my wishes uh i like to do things for him like cook for him and do his laundry which is insane because i dont like to do my own laundry this is everything you need to know about why women arent ahead were just willing to do nice stuff for other people because it makes us feel good i didnt want this to be my life i didnt know cooking and doing laundry for a man would do something like bring me joy but it does i love to do it i love to take care of him its really lovely i started using fabric softener because of him i never used fabric softener before because i thought fabric softener was a scheme i thought it was a scheme by big laundry to just get us to use another liquid and so ive never used it before and one day he comes up to me and he approached me about this like anyone does who like wants something to keep happening you know he was like hey baby i love you so much do you ever notice our clothes are a little bit crunchyand when ',\n",
       "  'i hear crunchy clothes the first thing i think of is semen right but i know thats not why these clothes are crunchy cause i know where all the semen is going you know guys dont be gross in the trash can which is what i call my vaginathis is a this is just a tiny peek into a comedians life i riffed that joke on stage one night and i liked it so much that i was like id rather keep calling my vagina a trash can than not do that joke so the clothes are crunchy and its not cause of the semen because thats in old trash can over here hes like ever notice our clothes are crunchy i was like yeah i have noticed and he was like maybe we could start using fabric softener and then i went on my whole fabric softener is a scheme rant and he didnt leave you know so i thought that was pretty good and so i bought fabric softener and i started using it and you know what happens when you put fabric softener onto the clothes that you then put on your body it makes them softer its a perfectlynamed product i shouldve been using it this whole time know what i blame i blame the marketing theyre marketing this product wrong you got to get rid of that gay snuggie bear hes gay right him and the pillsbury doughboy theyre gay theyre theyre just out there touching tummies you know what fabric softener needs know what mascot fabric softener needs a sturdy lesbian just a sturdy lesbian on the cover being like it works okay and im not used to a lot of the stuff that comes with relationships he says very romantic and sweet things to me you know like hell say things like i could just look into your eyes forever you have the most beautiful eyes which to be honest made me feel okay about my body you know like just my eyes okay uh then i do the very girly thing that we sometimes do id be like well what happens when i get old and uh like my i hopefully age terribly you know and you know everything starts falling apart hes like i dont care i could look into your eyes forever theyre so beautiful i absolutely love staring into your eyes which is like a really sweet thing to say but then i thought of one more question i wanted to ask him but i didnt ask it because theres only one right answer and i knew if he didnt say the right answer id have to leave the question i wanted to ask was okay so what if someone plucked out my eyes and i just had two sockets then what would you do i didnt ask that question cause theres only one right answer and the right answer is walk away quietlycause thats the funniest way to leave a newly blind',\n",
       "  ' person is are you still there i feel your energy and it is you know like oh i should mention the guy im in a relationship with hes a black man and the only reason im telling you that is so you know im a good person uh its really relevant for the next couple jokes they dont work as well if hes not black uh there was one night i got home and he was asleep on the couch and the tv was on and i dont know what he fell asleep to but when i came in there was a video playing about white privilege i was like this is the most passiveaggressive thing ive ever seen like im the white woman in this relationship im the passiveaggressive one how are you supposed to how dare you try to outwhitewoman me so i did the whitestwoman thing i could think of i called the police and now hes dead so im kidding we live in spain they dont do that there they just give you an olive and make you take a nap but you know its been really great and actually not just this relationship but everything over the past couple years its really taught me we should always lead with love and kindness no matter what the relationship youre in your friends your family strangers especially strangers we should always lead with love and kindness and of course were gonna argue of course were gonna disagree and hopefully those arguments never get too bad but no matter what happens you should always try to be the first person always try to be the first person to say why are you yelling cause if you say that youve won and thats what its really all about if you want itive got itif you need itive got it part 2 all struggles matterme too hi guys how are youits fine i dont really carei always like being here in philadelphiai love being here in denver you guys you know you have a good town always happy to be here in salt lakei love coming to madison i love being back herethis is gonna be fun were gonna have a good timeive been noticing lately that a lot of comedians have been using their time on stage to talk about their struggles and how they identify and i think thats good for comedyum guys this is serious soguys im about to talk about my struggles i thought you know i could use my platform here to talk about how i struggle and how i identify you remember likeyears ago this commercial would come on that would be like do you have the urge to move your legs at night do you get a creepy crawly feeling in your legs you might have restless leg syndrome well it turns out i have restless leg syndrome and you know how i got diagnosed with restless leg',\n",
       "  ' syndrome i listened to those symptoms and then i go yes i have it theres no cure and it is you get this like itchy kind of feeling in your legs at night you feel like you have to move them which also i mean even just to have this disease calling it a disease is a bit of a stretch its kind of like the white women of diseases you know where youre like is it a problem i dont like even to recognize that you have it you have to have a lot of time to rest i was just relaxing at home for hours when my legs were like move its either restless legs or its like prediabetes like its your body being like take a lapand its hard the more you talk about it kind of like the more like unbelievable it actually sounds like if there was a gofundme for restless leg syndrome and a cat who needed a wheelchair i think that cats getting a wheelchair we dont even know if he has restless legs cause he doesnt have anyoh dont be sad about a fake cat that i just made up and like this is not a great thing to complain about in the best of times but like were not in the best of times you know like were just out of pandemic people cant find baby formula gas is likean ounce meanwhile im like sometimes at night i have to wiggle my legs because of the itchys and the scratchys so i guess what id like to do tonight is id like to come out as insufferableyeahi feel validated because this black man just raised his glass to me and weunderstand suffering it has it has it has been a really hard time for white women i mean not literallylike a lot of people are coming out and talking about their struggles and white women are really trying to be a part of that its been kind of hard for us to do you know cause its hard to have like a struggle and a skin care routine like things are hard i did this joke the other night and a white lady screamed out she goes youre going the wrong way shes really having a hard time but i thought about it and i think white women i think i figured out what our struggle is i think our struggle is hearing how hard it is for other people is really hard for us like like we heard how hard it was for black people and we were devastated we saw pictures of the destruction in ukraine and we needed a social media break we heard about the crimes against humanity in palestine and we didnt really get into that one cause thats not one of the in crises but in general hearing how hard things are for other people has been really hard for us so hard we can barely make our own jewelryand like we blame a lot of stuff on whi',\n",
       "  'te men you know and women you have done a lot of stufflike dont even get mad about it youve been really terrible but youre really good at it you know like white men came over from europe annihilated a civilization and then rebranded it as thanksgiving thats like pretty impressive you know and we blame a lot of stuff on you guys which is very funny to me because we act like we havent participated in it at all and we have participated at the most fundamental of levels we made youwere like the guy who made the atom bomb and were like but dont use it youd think weve spent all this time with white men you would think we would have picked up some tips and tricks by now you know you guys have the blueprint its like we havent learned anything its like we spent our whole life with michael jordan and only walked away with a bad gambling habit i think one of the reasons its been hard for us to get ahead is because white women we want to we dont want to give up being the victim you know but we also want to be in charge we want to be the head victim in charge you know we want to be the manager but we also want to be able to ask for the manager like i need to speak to the manager oh no thats me and im a bitch and were really good at being the victim you know were good at it like were the bride of victims no matter whats happening to other people were like no no its my dayand my dads kind of paying for the whole thing so and sometimes i get a bit frustrated with white women because by the way this whole section is gonna be about you white women if you havent picked that up yet so if youre starting you know starting to take offense dont worry just cross your arms this is not what i came here for sometimes i feel like were waiting for things to be nice for us you know because ive said it before you know white women we are oppressed sexism definitely exists you know but white men you guys were smart you kept us comfortable it was a very airconditioned oppression like you know again i dont want to downplay what happens to women you know like obviously sexism exists a lot of women get murdered and assaulted um by like you know okay so i looked up the statistics for this um for the joke not because i caredbut of the women who get murderedof them get murdered by someone they knowof that is by their husband so not are we getting murdered were getting murdered by the people who we love the most you know and then i heard about all these trans women getting murdered and assaulted and all i could think of when ',\n",
       "  'i heard that was welcome jump on in the water is terrible and full of missing womensome people will say no statistically more trans women are getting murdered im like are they getting murdered cause theyre trans or are they getting murdered cause theyre not used to presenting as a woman you know like i can understand if theyre getting murdered someones murdering them theyre like this is cause youre transby the way sorry im im stabbing the person i just looked at myself doing that i was like it looks like okay im not jerking the person off its a very different situation this is cause youre trans its a fun surprise you know technically maybe you could murder someone that way i dont know probably take a whileyoure almost out you know what im saying i no this is a knife and im stabbing this this is cause youre trans if thats how theyre getting murdered okay yes its because theyre trans or you know is it because theyre not used to presenting as women and theyre doing you know stuff they shouldnt be doing like walking home at night like you used to be a lion now youre a gazelle theres different rules bitch okay you cant do everything you used to be able to do you cant just hang around vans like what what happened did you speak up in a meeting or did you do the most dangerous thing of all did you marry the love of your life so i understand i understand when women are unhappy with society you know it makes sense to me but youre unhappy with society do something about it you know all i see is these white women karening and thats really frustrating to me first of all karening isnt new karenings been happening since the beginning of time you guys just finally started recording it like theres literally like cave paintings of karens its just a woman whos like youre not supposed to have a fire here karening frustrates me cause its such an ineffective use of your power you know like when white men are unhappy with society they really do something about it they really get in there you know they run for office they change laws they gerrymander they get their hands dirty you know when were unhappy with society we dont do that we just like knock over a display in target its so frustrating i think sometimes we think that like you know as individuals we cant create change and you can just you as an individual you can create change i see men do it all the time women you can do it on your own you know like um ted kaczynski wasnt happy with society and you know what he did he built a perfectly symmetrical ca',\n",
